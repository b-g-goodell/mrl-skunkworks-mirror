1. BUDGET ACTUALS

The budget document has the budget in detail, broken down by month and category. Here are the projected and actual budget numbers, along with the value of remaining liquid assets as of July 19 at around noon mountain time (these are about 46.5 XMR and about 0.0151 XBT and some shitcoin dust leftover from an incidental transaction).

|                    |   PROJECTED   |    ACTUAL     |
|--------------------|:-------------:|--------------:|
| INCOME             |  $96,029.65   |  $ 61,587.64  |
| EXPENSES           |  $63,750.00   |  $100,210.22  |
| INCOME - EXPENSES  |  $96,029.65   |  $ 61,587.64  |
| REMAINING ASSETS   |  $96,029.65   |  $  5,807.27  |
| ACTUAL NET SAVINGS |  $96,029.65   | -$32,815.31   |

We sold 60 general attendance tickets, 4 student tickets, and 9 platinum tickets. We had 27 speakers and panelists, 11 sponsors (who brought an additional 5 people). Total attendance was 116. See the budget document for more details.

Note: This financial loss is mine (Surae’s). According to the original conditions of the CCS as I put forth, we pledged all profits to future Konferencos and we accepted to take on any loss from the event. We don’t recommend doing it this way in the future. See our guide documents.

2. PROJECTING SALES IS GRIEF. VOLATILITY IS PAIN. SURPRISE GUESTS ARE DELIGHTFUL.

We know more for next year now. 
  * Preliminary data from Magical Crypto Conference suggested 60% of tickets would be sold in the final few weeks. 
  * Our data suggest the number is closer to 40%. Due to this, we over-estimated attendance significantly.
  * For the budget to balance without further corporate sponsorships, tickets would have had to have been quadrupled in price, which would have been unreasonable.
  * We requested 60,100 USD worth of XMR when XMR was reliably trading above 100 USD per XMR. This amount was funded on 30 January 2019. I received the funds on 5 February 2019. The XMR were worth around 28,510 USD. The difference, 31,590 USD, accounts for over 80% of our loss.

3. THE GOOD: UNDER-, ON-, AND ALMOST-ON-BUDGET EXPENSES.

There are a variety of ways we did a good job reducing costs.
  * The fee for the program manager was on-budget. 
  * The cost of venue rental was under-budget because they bundled catering, hotel rooms, and A/V; the cost of venue rental was nearly free, but we ended up paying a lot for catering and audio/visual as a consequence. 
  * Specifically printing posters was on-budget (although the rest of “Print Materials” was not). 
  * The cost of speaker airfare was 350 USD per speaker lower than projected, but we had 7 additional speakers. In total, we ended up reducing our costs here by about 2493 USD.
  * We slightly overshot our budget for hotel rooms for speakers, but not by much thanks to some sponsors taking the burden of speaker travel onto their shoulders.
  * Everything else was over-budget or off-budget entirely, unaccounted for in our projections.

4. THE BAD: OVER-BUDGET EXPENSES.

There are a variety of reasons we went overbudget for each item. These are they.
  * Print materials and gift bags. We projected a cost of 3,000 USD for badges, posters, programs, banners, stickers, and welcome bags. We actually spent 6,005 USD for these things, doubling the budget. 
    * We paid 4.84 USD per badge, roughly.
    * We paid 4.40 USD per bag, roughly.
    * We paid under 1 USD for programs.
    * We paid about 1 USD each for rubik’s cubes
    * We paid 6.25 USD per USB data blocker, roughly.
    * We included a 10 USD t-shirt in each bag. 
    * Some promising but ultimately fruitless sponsorship talks led us to include t-shirts under the assumption of additional income. In future years, t-shirts should be sold and some projected income from t-shirts should be budgeted. Rehrar can help us project future numbers based on size of events.
    * In future years, sponsorships should be added to both the projected budget and actual budget only after money is in hand. Promised money is worth nothing.
    * Properly budgeting for swag bags is important and delicate. Future organizers should get a swag bag budget from their steering committee.
  * Catering. We projected 6,650 USD for catering based on some local restaurants quotes. We spent 28,335.64 USD for catering at the venue. 
    * This could have been mitigated somewhat, but we were stuck with 22,496 USD in food/beverage minimum on June 1 based on our revised projected attendance (at that point, this was 150 attendees).
    * This totalled around 150 USD per person in our projection.
      * Note that ticket prices did not cover our projected catering amount.
    * Fewer people showed up and they ate more
    * Catering, venue rental, hotel rooms, and audio/visual came bundled, and costs like venue rental were waived in favor of food and beverage minimums.
    *  We tried to get good estimates from multiple locations, but the bundling made it extremely difficult.
    * This may seem like a good deal, but when catering is packaged, it is often overpriced. It is often cheaper (and more interesting) to rent the venue separately from the caterer.
    * Next year, organizers should anticipate lower-than-expected or higher-than-expected attendance and adjust catering needs accordingly; we had very little idea of what to expect, and so we erred (too far) on the generous side.
    * Next year, a committee should approve catering decisions based on more than one estimate, and the committee should do their best to use apples-to-apples estimates comparisons (perhaps avoiding bundling altogether).
    * We want to re-emphasize that apples-to-apples comparisons for estimates and quotes are vital. It was very difficult to determine whether the bundled package was actually cheaper or not (it wasn’t).
    *  All-day beverage service was required for our event, and it was unfortunately rather expensive. “This is how they get ya.”
      * We could reduce breakfast on both days to “continental-style” bagels-and-cream-cheese style breakfasts to save money, and to reduce afternoon snacks to nuts or cookies.
      * But you can’t get rid of all-day coffee or make it cheaper without grumpy attendees.
      * Next year, we recommend that a specific coffee sponsor be found.
  * Speaker dinner. We had 50 folks attend the dinner at a cost of 3540 USD working out to 71 USD per attendee. We budgeted 2000 USD for a dinner with 30 people at 66.67 USD. 
    * Increased attendance had a greater impact than the 4.33 USD extra we paid per head.
    * Next year, a committee should approve decisions like the dinner.
    * I regret nothing about the dinner except under-estimating attendance and per-head cost.
  * Audio/Visual. This absolutely murdered us, with a budget almost triple our original projection.
    * The plan changed a few weeks before the Konferenco.
    * The first change was to edit the slides together with the speaker footage live and recording the input and output of this process.
    * Our original plan was to record videos and edit them together with speaker slides. Word to the wise: don’t do this, the videos never end up being posted.
    * The next change was to livestream everything instead of recording it. This is very expensive.

5. THE UGLY: OFF-BUDGET ITEMS.

There were a variety of items that we entirely failed to take into account this year. Here they are, with some comments.
  * Rebates for student tickets. This was a nice thing I recommend keeping.
    * On the scale of the event’s budget, this was a drop in the bucket. 
    * An anonymous donor made a donation on the condition we spent the money making student tickets free, and if anything was left over, to do with what we will. So this expense was paid for specifically for by a sponsor.
    * It’s optional each year based on how sales are doing. 
    * I regret only not including this in the budget in the first place.
  * Venue (taxes, fees, nickels, dimes). This category cost six times as much as giving rebates to student tickets. 
    * Next budget should take into account taxes by some percentage in every relevant category.
    * In our case, taxes were paid per-room through the hotel and service charges were paid through audio/visual.
    * In Colorado, if future events are selling t-shirts to mitigate costs, or if more than two vendors are on premises, they need to handle sales tax somehow.
  * Whiteboards, markers, supplies: Again, not an original part of the budget; I regret only not including this in the budget in the first place.
  * Outreach: There are a huge number of nontrivial costs for outreach and promotion. If these are ignored, turnout is lower than expected and the event doesn’t pay for itself.
    * Donation to media team: Oh my freaking gosh, Thunderosa did a fantastic job on the Konferenco graphics. And graphics artists get totally fucked all the time for their work, which is highly undervalued. We recommend budgeting payment for graphics artists and folks who are working on promotion, even if they are volunteering.
    * Promotional/media advertising: It’s surprisingly expensive to run a promotional campaign through twitter or reddit or a local underground newspaper. Future budgets should include a promotional/outreach plan and some explanation of the approach being taken.
    * Web dev and cost of website. This is inevitable, although we paid more than we will need to in future years to get a simple serverless back-end payment system that works with both Stripe and Globee and does simple ticket inventory stuff. In future events, Big Neon or Tari may be a cool alternative, if the budget can support the fees. 

6. WHAT-IF?

Consider the following what-if scenarios:
  * What if we had stuck with the original A/V plan?
    * We would have paid around 7500 USD in expenses for A/V instead of 13,888 USD (we still would have been 2500 USD over budget).
    * The talks would not have been streamed.
    * Our inter-continental panel with Zcon1 couldn’t have happened.
    * This is the most undesirable way to save money. DO NOT DO THIS. Instead, budget for expensive A/V.
  * What if the market had held steady at about 100-105 USD per XMR? 
    * The Konferenco would have had an additional 31,590.16 USD in income.
    * This would have left an additional 5210 USD deficit.
  * What if we paid for no airfare? What about lodging/accommodations? What about both?
    * Airfare cost 14,482.63 USD.
    * Speaker accommodations cost 10,695.30 USD.
    * Paying nothing for both of these would have saved 25,177.93 USD, leaving a deficit of 11,623 USD.
  * What if we did more modest welcome bags? 
    * We paid 4.40 USD for bags, a bit over 1 USD for rubik’s cubes, a bit over 6 USD for USB condoms, and 10 USD for shirts. 
    * We can replace this with a bag for under 2 USD and a single gift for 4 USD, saving 15.10 USD per attendee. 
    * In our case, this would have saved us 2265 USD. Nothing to sneeze at, but not much in comparison to our total defecit.
  * What if we had doubled ticket prices and this had no impact on number of sales?
    * We would have earned another 10,460 USD, approximately, leaving a deficit of 26,341 USD.
    * Note that doubling the price would have likely decreased total number of tickets sold, so this is not a realistic what-if.
  * What if we went easy on catering? Here are some ballpark values from 2019:
    * All-day beverage service is a must for a conference. 
      * 8 hours of all-day coffee/tea/soda/water service costs between 20 - 55 USD a head.
      * We paid 20 USD per head in 2019.
    * Folks appreciate pre- and post-lunch snacks, it helps attention late in the afternoon or right before lunch; optional, but a good idea.
      * A snack break with fruits and vegetables and nuts, flatbread, cheeses, etc, costs 17 - 19 USD a head. 
        * We paid 19 USD per head in 2019.
        * If we had paid 17 USD per head, we would have saved 2 USD per attendee, totaling at most 300 USD.
      * Provide breakfast to ensure people show up in the mornings instead of getting caught at restuarants.
        * A continental-style breakfast with bagels and cream cheese costs 14 - 30 USD a head. An “afternoon break” with sweets can be misappropriated as a breakfast for 19-25 USD per head. A fancier breakfast with eggs and french toast, etc, costs 23 - 39 USD per head. 
        * We paid 30 USD a head for one breakfast and 20 for another in 2019.
        * If we had paid 14 USD a head for both breakfasts, we would have saved 11 USD per attendee, totaling at most 1650 USD.
    * The point is: there wasn’t a lot of wiggle room here compared to the scale of the budget.
    * Catering, A/V, hotel rooms, and venue space rental were bundled. This made it difficult to budget everything together, and treat catering like a single variable like we have above.
  * What if we had used a service like EventBrite or Big Neon or Tari instead of doing web development?
    * Most ticket management platforms charge between 2.5% and 5% of ticket values, sometimes with an additional fee of a dollar or whatever.
    * Going with a service like EventBrite would have cost us 2.5% of our 10,460 USD in sales plus an additional dollar per ticket sold (in our case, 76 USD), totaling 337.5 USD.
    * The initial estimates for web development we got were much smaller, and the project ran over these estimates.
      * The cost of homebrewing a ticket inventory system was an order of magnitude larger (3832.37 USD) than the cost of EventBrite or Tari or Big Neon. 
      * On the other hand, our web development costs if we re-use our system will approach zero very quickly in future years; it may be worth using it once or twice more to get some use out of it.
    * We recommend against brew-it-yourself approaches here; just go with Big Neon.

7. RECOMMENDATIONS FOR 2020.

We recommend the following ways to mitigate costs and improve income in the future:
  * Mitigating expenses: 
    * Airfare and hotel costs: Reduce the amount of speaker airfare assistance and lodging assistance.
      * Set a budget for these things early.
      * Decide how to use budgeted funds early.
        * Lottery among all speakers?
        * Speakers apply for the assistance?
    * Audio/visual: Reduce A/V costs by requesting equipment from the community, but don’t reduce A/V costs by going for a sub-standard show.
      * parasew and marcvvs and sgp brought so much A/V equipment they saved us thousands in rental costs, and they even saved us on other costs by helping the A/V guys with labor.
      * Do not reduce A/V costs by going with lower quality workmanship or material. Having sound at least is critical.
      * Try to cover the complete cost of A/V with corporate sponsorships. The cost per-attendee of covering A/V leads to very high per-ticket costs.
    * Ticket management: Don’t be clever, just go with EventBrite or Tari or Big Neon. Re-using the system from 2019 is feasible for no fees, but the current system is unfinished and will require some nontrivial development costs.
  * Improving income:  
    * Ticket prices and per-attendant costs 
      * Requirement: ensure that ticket prices cover the fundamental costs of each attendee. 
        * Catering per person 
        * Welcome bags 
        * If ticket prices seem unreasonable… 
          * seek corporate sponsors specifically for bringing down ticket prices or
          * seek a corporate “rebate sponsor” responsible for providing a rebate at the door for attendants. People like getting cash at the door.
          * Increasing ticket prices will inevitably decrease attendance. Consider raising prices only as a last resort.
        * How much should ticket sales exceed the cost of catering and bags?
          * Compute the cost of catering and welcome bags in the event that the target headcount is met.
          * Identify some critical percentage of ticket sales defining a “bust” of an event. For example, you could say that if only 75% or 50% the target headcount purchase tickets, the event is a bust.
          * Ticket prices should be set high enough so that ticket sales _in the event of a bust_ could cover the cost of catering and welcome bags _in the event that target headcount is met_.
            * For example, if the cost of catering and welcome bags with a full conference is 39,000 USD with 300 people, and the “bust” percentage is 50%, then ticket prices for 150 attendees should cover 39,000 USD. This example works out to 260 USD per ticket.
          * If ticket prices are unreasonable, the fixed per-attendee costs must come down.
    * Sell merchandise.
      * We did not sell merchandise at the 2019 Konferenco for fear that we would waste inventory.
      * Instead, we wasted inventory by giving t-shirts away.
      * It’s better for the budget to (i) order 100 t-shirts at 10 USD a pop and sell 20 of them for 15 USD a pop, instead of (ii) order 200 t-shirts and give all of them away.
    * Have a plan for event promotion to hit target ticket sales.
      * Track ticket sales. If they start lagging behind targets, increase promotional activity.
      * Track the effectiveness of various promotional methods for future reference.
    * Have a plan for obtaining corporate sponsorships, which should be a major (and ultimately the only) source of income for Konferencos.
    * Handle money more efficiently: This is hard to quantify when all of our crypto trades ended up being gains. 
      * Market volatility:
        * Future CCS funding requests for Konferencos could seek at least some funding in Tether or some stablecoin pegged to fiat, or that CCS managers hold Konferenco funding in Tether before payout.
        * We recommend cashing out 100% of crypto donations into fiat until to the projected expenses of the event are matched.
        * Since budgeting an event like this with a volatile asset means not knowing how much money will be available to pay for various projects.
        * At least in the US, every crypto transaction is potentially taxable, so moving crypto around a lot is undesirable on the tax side also.
        * We recommend that future CCS funding requests for Konferencos be broken up into stages (easy) or that payout can begin before funding is complete (trickier).
          * One big danger is that the final stage of funding falls through.
          * One big benefit is that this mitigates the problem where all the CCS Konferenco funds are eaten by market volatility.
          * The early stages of funding will guarantee the event happens and that corporate sponsorships begin to roll in. If later stages fall through, then the Konferenco may be lackluster, but it will still take place.
